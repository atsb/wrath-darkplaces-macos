# wrathplaces

A fixed and cleaned up version of the Wrath Darkplaces fork.

This is the fork of [LordHavoc's DarkPlaces Quake engine](https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/) that is used in the game [WRATH: Aeon of Ruin](http://wrath.game/).
It's based on the [13/05/2014 DarkPlaces source snapshot](https://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/files/darkplacesengine20140513.zip), with some minor additions and alterations.

## This repository
This repository contains the up-to-date version of the source code used to build the WRATH binaries. It'll be updated with every Steam/GOG update that changes the binaries.

Contributers are welcome.

## Building
Currently the only version of the executable on Steam/GOG is the WGL x64 build. SDL/SDL2 builds work on both Windows and Linux, but have some mouse-related issues in the UI. The Linux GLX build has slight sound issues with the ALSA backend.

macOS also is working with SDL2.

### Dependencies
Visual Studio Projects are fixed.

(or at least what the Steam/GOG binaries are built and shipped with)
* `mingw-w64` / `gcc`;
* `libjpeg` or `libjpeg-turbo`;
* `libogg`, `libvorbis` and `libvorbisfile`;
* `libpng 1.6`;
* `libfreetype`;
* `libd0_blind_id`;
* `libcurl`;
* `libSDL 1.2` or `libSDL 2.0` for the SDL/SDL2 builds.

For example, in MSYS2 you can use the following command to get pretty much everything you need:
```
pacman -S git mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-{gcc,make,cmake} mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-{libjpeg-turbo,libogg,libvorbis,libpng,freetype,curl,SDL2}
```

### Instructions
1. Install dependencies (if you're using msys2, you can get most of these using pacman; some libraries are loaded dynamically and you can just copy the DLLs from the game folder, or from a DarkPlaces release); 
1. `cd` to this directory;
2. Run `make` to get the list of available targets.
3. `make` your desired target.

`make cl-release`/`make cl-debug` will build the WGL executable on Windows and the GLX executable on Linux.

Use `make sdl2-release`/`make sdl2-debug` to build the SDL2 version. Remove the `2` for the SDL1.2 version.

## Running
Rename your binary to `wrath` (or `wrath.exe` on Windows), place it into the game directory and run it.

Alternatively instead of renaming you can pass `-wrath` as a command line parameter: `./darkplaces-sdl -wrath`.

## Source Port Future
This source port of Wrath will be updated and developed more frequently once the full complete game has shipped.  There are many things I'd love to do, but I want to keep a known, working base until the full product is with us.  Wrathplaces will eventually become the 'quakespasm' of Wrath, once full development begins.
